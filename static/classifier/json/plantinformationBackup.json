        "comments": "The growth of B. alba is limited by low temperatures, altitudes higher than 500 m, and day/night temperature variations (PIER, 2017). Although it is cultivated worldwide up to 2600 m elevation and in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas, the species will grow best in hot, dry humid climates and in areas below 500 m elevations (PROTA; 2017; ZipcodeZoo, 2017). The optimum mean annual temperatures for B. alba are 23 to 27°C, but it can tolerate a temperature range of 10 to 35°C. It does not tolerate frost and requires a minimum daytime temperature of 15°C. It does not do well if night temperature drops below 14°C, but it will tolerate night temperatures occasionally falling below 10°C. It prefers an annual precipitation range of 2000 to 2500 mm but will tolerate 700 to 4200 mm. The species prefers well-drained fertile sandy loam soils and full sun to light shade situations. It can grow in soils with a pH range of 5.5 – 7 but can tolerate 4.3 - 7.5. It tolerates poor soils and short periods of drought (Useful Tropical Plants, 2017). It is intolerant to salinity and standing water (PROTA, 2017).",

        "scientificName": "Broussonetia papyrifera",
        "localName": "Lapnis",
        "description": "B. papyrifera is a medium to large deciduous tree. The crown is round and spreading. It is a hardy, fast-growing tree and under favourable conditions in a hot, moist climate can attain a height of 21 m and a diameter of 70 cm (Luna, 1996). Its stout, grey-brown, spreading branches are brittle and susceptible to wind damage. The branches are marked with stipular scars. Young branchlets are subtomentose and shoots are pubescent when young. The bark is light-grey, smooth, with shallow fissures or ridges. The stem, branches and petioles contain a milky latex (Luna, 1996).\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    B. papyrifera has variable mulberry-like papery leaves. Some leaves are distinctly deep lobed, while others are unlobed. Several different shapes of leaves may appear on the same shoot. The leaves are alternate/subopposite, ovate, acuminate, dentate-crenate, their bases often oblique, scabrous above, with a woolly surface on the lower side. The leaves are 9.7 x 6.6 cm in size. The petioles are 3-10 cm long and the stipules 1.6-2.0 cm long (Parker, 1956).\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    B. papyrifera is unisexual and dioecious. The male flower is 3.5-7.5 cm long, yellowish-white, with pendulous catkin-like spikes. The perianth is campanulate, hairy, 4-fid, and its segments are valvate. The female flowers are in rounded clusters in globose pedunculate heads about 1.3 cm in diameter. Persistent, hairy, clavate bracts subtend flowers. The fruit is shiny-reddish, fleshy, globose and compound with the achenes hanging on long fleshy stalks. The achenes are 1-2 cm long and wide.",
        "habitat": "B. papyrifera is native to East Asia with its warm and humid climate, with a temperature range of 0-40°C and with an annual rainfall of up to 2500 mm (Sheikh, 1993). It prefers a sub-humid warm, sub-tropical monsoon climate. The tree is remarkable for the variety of climates in which it can be grown, being hardy enough to survive in Europe. However its growth in cool climates is not as vigorous as in a warm, moist climate (Parker, 1956).\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    B. papyrifera requires moist, well-drained soil and has been unsuccessful when tried on poor soil. It prefers sandy loams and light soils. Stiff clay and hard laterite soils prevent penetration of the roots to the sub-soil, resulting in stunted growth (Luna, 1996).",
        "propagation": "B. papyrifera is insect- and wind-pollinated, and can be grown from seed (sown and self-sown), stem cuttings, coppice and root suckers. Most plantations of this species in India and Pakistan are from self-sown seed, coppice or root suckers. It regenerates freely from seed in moist places where there is not already heavy plant cover, and seedlings can become a problem around mature trees. It can also be readily grown from cuttings, even in December (Parker, 1956). Intensive planting is avoided, however, because the wood is no longer commonly used on a commercial scale (Bokhari, 1973).\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Seeds are light and small, with about 540,000 seeds per kilogram. The germination rate of seeds is 50% and the seedling survival rate is 25-30% (Luna, 1996). Seed germination starts three weeks after sowing and is completed within four months. Green immature fruits treated with ethylene at 0.1% concentration for 48 hours at 18°C become ripe and can then be sown in nursery beds. Seeds collected in June usually show a tendency to be dormant for about one month after sowing, indicating a period of after-ripening. Seed dispersed by birds has been observed to germinate readily.",
        "nativeRange": "B. papyrifera is native to East Asia and is extensively cultivated within its natural range for its bark. Native to China, Taiwan and Japan and possibly native to the Pacific islands of Hawaii and Samoa.",
        "invasiveType": "invasive",
        "comments": "B. papyrifera is a highly invasive species, becoming weedy and difficult to remove after its introduction. Its timber does not have high commercial value. Due to its excessive growth, it has become an agent of change in the whole ecosystem affecting native flora, human beings and causing economic losses.",
        "control": "Plans to manually eradicate B. papyrifera have met with limited success because of gregarious vegetative reproduction and its invasive nature through seeds. Newly sprouted shoots from tree stumps and suckers are cut and burnt, being replaced by higher quality native timber trees, however this is not an effective method. The most common techniques are manual control methods, by hand pulling, hand picking, cutting, etc., but are not enough for complete management of the tree. Biological control has not yet been used for control of B. papyrifera, it may be the most appropriate way through selection and introduction of a suitable biological control agent.\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    B. papyrifera has the capability of massive water consumption, a reason why they are more often seen around water, but also slowing the flow of water in channels and suppressing the growth of other plants. These channels not only provide water but also work as a dispersal source for the seeds. The huge canopy of the tree besides covering the outsized area provides shade over the closely growing trees and local shrubs, which creates competition for light, space and water.",

        "habitat": "It grows in many soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It does not tolerate shade and thrives well in open areas (Ecoport).  Forms dense stands which prevent establishment of other species, both due to competition and allelopathic effects.  Requires disturbance to become established.  When dry, is a flashy fuel which promotes wildland fires. \r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \"An opportunistic weed generally confined to forest edges and clearings.  It can form dense thickets in disturbed areas and may prevent recruitment of native plant species, thereby delaying successional processes.  Dense infestations can increase the intensity and frequency of fire, leading to further changes in the structure and composition of native plant communities.  C. odorata has the potential to colonise tropical and sub-tropical areas where annual rainfall exceeds 1000 mm per annum.  In its native habitat, the plant trives in tropical rainforest clarings and river flats, appearing early in the successional stage, rapidly establishing dense thickets and then gradually disappearing as the rainforest canopy closes over.  C. odorata can grow on most soils but prefers well-drained sites and will not grow in water-logged or saline soils.  Tree clearing for agriculture and other development appears to facilitate spread of the plant, which is quick to colonise roadsides, forest edges, plantations and pastures.  Agricultural districts, where original rainforest cover has been fragmented into small reserves and corridors, is particularly vulnerable to invasion.\"  (Csurhes & Edwards, 1998; p. 31-32).\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    C. odorata can be considered as a major weed in all perennial crops of the humid tropics as well as in forestry. It also invades pastures. Its aggressiveness is much more serious in the Old World tropics where it is an exotic, rather than in its native Americas. C. odorata is found mainly in the humid part of the inter-tropical zone at elevations below 2000 m, in open secondary habitats such as cultivated lands, abandoned or neglected fields, forest clearings, wastelands, along forest trails, fence rows, roadsides and forest margins. Gils et al. (2006) found significant differences in four habitats invaded in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, concluding that spread along paths and lack of control in state forest mean that it is most abundant there, followed by eucalyptus plantations, and a low abundance in sugar cane fields and communal grasslands is thought to be due to fires and ground cover.",
        "propagation": "Wind-dispersed seeds. Seeds also cling to hair, clothing and shoes. The tiny seeds can occur as a contaminant in imported seed or on vehicles and machinery. Vehicle traffic can spread the seed along roads. Can propagate vegetatively from stem and root fragments. (Waterhouse & Mitchell, 1998; pp. 23-24).",
        "nativeRange": "\"Native from Florida through the West Indies and from Texas through Central and South America to Argentina (Howard 1989, Liogier 1997). It has been accidentally or deliberately introduced and has naturalized throughout much of the tropics\"",
        "invasiveType": "invasive",
        "comments": "The aggressive nature and competitiveness of C. odorata in the Palaeotropics can be explained by the lack of host-specific natural enemies. In its native range in the Neotropics, it is attacked by a large number of arthropods (Crutwell, 1974; Gagne, 1977) and diseases (Elango et al., 1993; Barreto and Evans, 1994), reviewed by Crutwell McFadyen (1991). The most damaging and those that are promising potential biological control agents are given in the List of Natural Enemies, which includes successful introductions that have already been made. These natural enemies are either host-specific or only attack a narrow range of species related to C. odorata.",

Triclopyr has proven to be the most effective.

Of these, only the last has become established, fairly readily in Sri Lanka, Guam and other Micronesian islands, but with some difficulty in India and Sabah (Malaysia) and it has since spread unaided to the Philippines and Brunei.  It failed to become established in Thailand, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.  It has produced spectacular defoliation and death of many plants in Guam and striking but sporadic defoliation in Sri Lanka.  In India, populations have built up but damage has seldom been great.  Where established, it is heavily attacked by a range of predators and these are believed to have prevented successful establishment in several countries. \r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \"The eriophyid mite Acalitus adoratus causes abnormal growth of the epidermal hairs on young leaves and stems of C. odorata.

It is also widespread in Java and Sumatra, but there is no information from other Indonesian islands.  It is present in Yap and Palau in the Caroline Islands and was observed on Guam in November 1993 (R. Muniappan pers. comm.)\"  (Waterhouse, 1994; pp. 39, 41).

        "description": "\"A shrub or small tree; bark smooth, light reddish-brown, with pubescent 4-angled young branches; leaves opposite, ovate-elliptic or oblong-elliptic, acute-acuminate, pubescent beneath, often rather brittle, prominently nerved, lateral nerves 10-20 pairs; blades mostly 7-15 cm long and 3-5 cm wide, rounded at base, dull green; flowers solitary or 2-4 together in leaf axils, rather large (2.5 cm wide); peduncle about 1-2 cm long, pubescent; calyx 4-5-lobed (anthesis, not before) about 6-8 mm long, petals white, 10-15 mm long, fugacious, usually 4 or 5, obovate, slightly concave, stamens numerous (c. 200-250), white, about as long as petals; style 10-12 mm long, stigma peltate, fruit globose, ovoid, or pyriform, whitish-yellow or faintly pink, sweet-sour pulpy, many-seeded, 2.5-10 cm long; pulp granular-juicy; seeds yellowish, reniform\" (Stone, 1970; pp. 454-455).",
        "habitat": "\"Guava grows on soils of all textures derived from most parent materials. Well-drained and poorly drained soils, soils with pH's from 4.5 to 9.4, mildly salty soils, and soils both rich and poor in basic cations are tolerated. Guava grows at near sea level in coastal environments up to 2,300 m in elevation in Ecuador (Morton 1987). It grows naturally in areas of Puerto Rico that receive from about 1000 to 3000 mm of mean annual precipitation. Guava withstands drought very well. The species is moderately intolerant of shade. It develops a broad, low crown if open grown, grows a more vertical crown with side shade, and becomes tall and spindly in intermediate crown positions. Saplings can endure a few years in the understory of low basal-area secondary forests. Guava survives the competition of weeds, grass, and brush well. Growth is benefited by root association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Samarao and Martins 1999).  This thin-barked species is easily top-killed by fire and is sensitive to frost (von Carlowitz 1991)\"  (Wildland shrubs of the United States and its territories). \r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    This evergreen tree reaches heights of 8 m. It invades disturbed sites and forms dense thickets. Cultivated in gardens but often escaped and naturalized where introduced.  Common on abandoned fields (C. W. Smith, 1985; p. 200). \" A major problem in pastures, roadsides and forest planting, and is also common in plantations, but not in cultivation\"  (Swarbrick, 1997; p. 18).  In Hawai‘i, \"naturalized and often forming dense stands in disturbed dry, mesic, and wet forest, 15-1,220 m\"  (Wagner et al., 1999; p. 972).  In Fiji, \"An abundantly naturalized tree or shrub 1-10 m high from near sea level to about 800 m, often forming dense thickets in waste places, along roadsides, and in pastoral, arable, and plantation land\"  (A. C. Smith, 1985; pp. 307-308).  In Niue, \"a common or very common species in scrub and open secondary forest in most areas\"  (Sykes, 1970; p. 131). In New Caledonia, \"est vite devenu un fléau dans les pâturages. Planté à Lifou par Deplance (1864) et aujourd'hui souvent spontané aux îles Loyauté, où il est moins envahissant que sur la Grande-Terre\" (MacKee, 1994; p. 106). In the Galápagos Islands, \"common in the more mesic forests of the larger islands\" (Wiggins & Porter, 1971; p. 708).",
        "propagation": "The seeds are dispersed by frugivorous birds as well as rats and feral pigs.  \"The seeds are spread by birds and fruit bats and the plants regrow from stumps and buds along damaged roots.\"  (Swarbrick, 1997; p. 18)",
